title: Precise and imprecise Bayesianism applied to gas-solid reactions
abstract: Gas–solid reactions play a crucial role in sustainability, yet very few
  studies have focused on the uncertainty of their chemical kinetic parameters and
  its propagation. In this pioneering work, based on a numerically generated synthetic
  dataset of conversion profiles, we address the uncertainty arising from variations
  in powder particle size between any two small powder samples, which impacts experimental
  conversion profiles. This variation is assumed to follow a log-normal distribution
  and is propagated into the uncertainty of the activation energy, which subsequently
  affects the uncertainty of the delay time at which the chemical conversion reaches
  a desired value under other conditions. Both precise and imprecise Bayesian approaches
  were compared. The results indicate that precise Bayesian methods struggle to differentiate
  effectively between varying levels of knowledge. In contrast, the imprecise Bayesian
  method based on a set of truncated normal distributions proved efficient and significantly
  more useful than the one based on uniform priors for this purpose. Finally, we provide
  suggestions on how to apply this methodology to more realistic settings.
