title: Distorting lower probabilities using common distortion models
abstract: 'Distortion or neighbourhood models are useful tools in the imprecise probability
  theory allowing to robustify a probabilistic model by considering a neighbourhood
  around a given probability measure. In this work, we tackle the more general problem
  of distorting a lower probability. This problem can be interesting when we believe
  that a given lower probability is too precise, or in coalitional game theory when
  the set of solutions is empty. Our main purpose is to investigate how the linear
  vacuous and pari mutuel models can be defined for the distortion of lower probabilities,
  and for this aim we address the problem in a more general manner: we extend the
  vertical barrier models, which include the linear vacuous and pari mutuel models,
  and investigate the properties they satisfy.'
