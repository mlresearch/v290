title: 'The AI off-switch problem as a signalling game: bounded rationality and incomparability'
abstract: 'The off-switch problem is a critical challenge in AI control: if an AI
  system resists being switched off, it poses a significant risk. In this paper, we
  model the off-switch problem as a signalling game, where a human decision-maker
  communicates its preferences about some underlying decision problem to an AI agent,
  which then selects actions to maximise the human’s utility. We assume that the human
  is a bounded rational agent and explore various bounded rationality mechanisms.
  Using real machine learning models, we reprove prior results and demonstrate that
  a necessary condition for an AI system to refrain from disabling its off-switch
  is its uncertainty about the human’s utility. We also analyse how message costs
  influence optimal strategies and extend the analysis to scenarios involving incomparability.'
