title: Function-coherent gambles
abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a foundational approach to imprecise
  probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility assumptions. This paper
  introduces <em>function-coherent gambles</em>, a generalization that accommodates
  non-linear utility while preserving essential rationality properties. We establish
  core axioms for function-coherence and prove a representation theorem that characterizes
  acceptable gambles through continuous linear functionals. The framework is then
  applied to analyze various forms of discounting in intertemporal choice, including
  hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic, scale-dependent, and state-dependent discounting.
  We demonstrate how these alternatives to constant-rate exponential discounting can
  be integrated within the function-coherent framework. This unified treatment provides
  theoretical foundations for modeling sophisticated patterns of time preference within
  the desirability paradigm, bridging a gap between normative theory and observed
  behavior in intertemporal decision-making under genuine uncertainty.
