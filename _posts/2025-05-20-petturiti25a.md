title: Dynamic $α$-DS mixture pricing in a market with bid-ask spreads
abstract: This paper faces the problem of pricing a European derivative contract inside
  a discrete-time market with frictions in the form of bid-ask spreads. To this aim,
  we use a Markov and time-homogeneous multiplicative binomial process under Dempster-Shafer
  uncertainty for modeling the bid price of a non-dividend paying stock. Next, by
  taking $\alpha$-mixtures of bid-ask prices, where $\alpha \in [0,1]$ acts like a
  pessimism index, we propose a dynamic pricing rule consisting in the recursive one-step
  $\alpha$-mixture of upper and lower conditional Choquet expectations. We provide
  a dynamic pricing rule that has a closed-form for monotonic contract functions.
  Finally, we perform a calibration procedure on market data, complying with the tuning
  of $\alpha$.
